# 🔧 Environment Setup

## 📝 First: Verify Your Environment
> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** OpenAI is installed in `/root/venv`

This command will:
- ✅ Activate the virtual environment
- ✅ Check Python version
- ✅ Verify OpenAI package
- ✅ Confirm API keys are set

> 💡 **Tip:** Without this step, nothing will work! The virtual environment **MUST** be active.

# 📚 What is OpenAI?

## 🏢 The Company
OpenAI is the company that created ChatGPT. They build the most advanced AI models in the world.

## 🤖 Their AI Models
- **GPT-4**: The smartest (but expensive)
- **GPT-4.1-mini**: Fast and cheap (we'll use this)
- **GPT-3.5**: The older, simpler version

## 🔑 The OpenAI Library
The `openai` Python library is your gateway to these AI models. It handles:
- Authentication with your API key
- Sending your questions to AI servers
- Getting responses back

> 💡 **Concept:** Think of it like this: OpenAI runs the AI brain in the cloud. Your Python code talks to it using their library.

---

# 🔐 Understanding API Authentication & Client Setup

## 🤝 What is an API Client?
Think of the client as your connection manager to OpenAI. It handles all the complex networking so you can just focus on asking questions!

## 🔑 What's an API Key?
Your API key is like a password that tells OpenAI:
- Who you are (authentication)
- That you're allowed to use their AI
- Which account to bill for usage

`OPENAI_API_KEY` = Your secret access code

## 🌐 What's the Base URL?
The base URL tells your client where to send requests:
- It's the address of OpenAI's servers
- Like a web address, but for API calls
- Different URLs can point to different AI services

`OPENAI_API_BASE` = Where the AI servers live

> 🚀 **What's Next?** In **Task 2**, you'll create this client using your API key and base URL - connecting your code to OpenAI's powerful AI!

# 💬 What are Chat Completions?

## 🗣️ It's a Conversation with AI
Chat Completions is OpenAI's conversational API. You send messages, AI responds - just like texting! The magic happens with `client.chat.completions.create()`.

## 🧠 Choose Your AI Model
Different models = different AI brains. You **MUST** specify which one:
- `gpt-4.1-mini`: Fast, cheap, smart enough for most tasks (we'll use this!)
- `gpt-4`: Genius level, but slow and expensive
- `gpt-3.5`: Older, less capable

## 🎭 The Three Roles in Conversations
- `"system"`: Instructions for how AI should behave (optional)
- `"user"`: That's you asking questions
- `"assistant"`: The AI's responses

## 📝 The Messages Format
Every API call needs these 2 parameters:

```python
client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",     # Which AI brain
    messages=[                        # The conversation
        {"role": "user", "content": "Your question here"}
    ]
)
```
*Messages is an array because you can send conversation history!*

> 🚀 **What's Next?** In **Task 3**, you'll use this exact format to make your first real API call and have your first conversation with AI!

# 📦 Understanding the Response Object

## 🔍 Why This Weird Path?
The response path `response.choices[0].message.content` seems complex, but each part has a reason.

## 📊 Breaking It Down
- `response`: The entire response object from OpenAI
- `.choices`: Array of possible responses (AI can generate multiple)
- `[0]`: Get the first (and usually only) choice
- `.message`: The message object containing role and content
- `.content`: The actual text of the AI's response!

## 🎯 Other Useful Fields
- `response.usage`: Token counts (prompt, completion, total)
- `response.model`: Which model actually responded
- `response.created`: Timestamp of the response
- `response.id`: Unique identifier for this response

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** 99% of the time, you just need `response.choices[0].message.content` for the text!

---

# 💰 Understanding Tokens & AI Economics

## 🧩 What Are Tokens?
Tokens are pieces of words that AI uses to process text:
- Simple words = 1 token ("cat", "run")
- Complex words = multiple tokens ("unbelievable" = ~3 tokens)
- **Rough estimate**: 1 token ≈ 4 characters
- **Average**: 1 token ≈ 0.75 words

## 📊 The Three Token Types
1. `prompt_tokens`: Your question (what you send)
2. `completion_tokens`: AI's answer (what you get back)
3. `total_tokens`: Sum of both (what you pay for)

Find them in: `response.usage`

## 💸 Why Tokens = Money
AI companies charge by tokens consumed:
- **Input tokens**: $0.80 per million ($0.0008/1K)
- **Output tokens**: $3.20 per million ($0.0032/1K)

> **Notice:** Output costs 4x more than input!
> 💡 **Tip:** This is why keeping AI responses concise saves money!

## 🏢 Real Business Impact
**Example: Customer Support Chatbot**

- 1,000 queries/day × $0.001 per query = $1/day
  - → Monthly: $30
  - → Yearly: $365

vs. **Human agent**: $25/hour × 8 hours = $200/day!

> 🚀 **What's Next?** In **Task 5**, you'll calculate real costs for API calls and see how to optimize spending for your business use case!
# Lab 1: AI Fundamentals - Your First AI Journey

## 🎯 What You'll Learn
Making your first AI API call through 5 micro-tasks - each building on the previous one, like climbing stairs one step at a time.

### Your 5-Step Journey:
1. **Task 1**: Import the OpenAI library (2 lines)
2. **Task 2**: Initialize the client with credentials (2 lines)
3. **Task 3**: Make your first API call (3 lines)
4. **Task 4**: Extract the AI's response (1 line)
5. **Task 5**: Understand token costs (2 lines)

## 🚀 Before You Start
- You've never coded with AI before? **Perfect!** This lab is for absolute beginners.
- Each task is just 1-3 lines to fill in
- Complete them in order (1→2→3→4→5)
- Total time: ~15 minutes

## 📚 Key Concepts Explained Simply

### What is an API Call?
Think of it like ordering food at a restaurant:
1. You (your code) place an order (send a message)
2. The kitchen (OpenAI's servers) prepares your order
3. The waiter (API) brings you the food (AI's response)
4. You enjoy your meal (use the response in your app)

### What are Tokens?
- Tokens are like "word pieces" the AI uses to understand and create text
- Both your question and AI's answer use tokens
- More tokens = higher cost (like phone minutes)
- **Rule of thumb**: 1 token ≈ 4 characters or 0.75 words

### The Response Object
When you call the API, you get back a "package" containing:
- `choices[0].message.content` → The actual text response
- `usage.prompt_tokens` → Tokens in your question
- `usage.completion_tokens` → Tokens in AI's answer
- `usage.total_tokens` → Total tokens (what you pay for)

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: What if I get an error?**
A: Each TODO shows EXACTLY what to type. Copy it character-for-character!

**Q: Why 5 separate tasks instead of one big file?**
A: Breaking it down helps you understand each piece. Once you get it, you'll combine them all!

**Q: What's with all the underscores (___)?**
A: They mark exactly where you need to fill in code. Replace them with the suggested values.

**Q: Can I skip ahead?**
A: Please don't! Each task builds on the previous one. Task 3 needs Task 2's client, etc.
